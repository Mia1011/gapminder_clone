# 200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes (Dashboard)

## Discription
I further advanced the visualization into an interactive dashboard with `Dash`, and then used `Render` for deployment. 

## Demo
Check the dashboard [here](https://gapminder-clone-interface.onrender.com). There will be a few seconds' wait since I didn't pay for it XP. 

There are three interactive objects:
- **Dropdown**: The Dropdown on the upperleft decides which continent's data is shown on the left side.
- **Slider**: The Slider at the bottom controls which year's data is shown. 
- **Bubbles**: If you click on one of the bubbles which represent countries, the accordinate data will show on the right side.
